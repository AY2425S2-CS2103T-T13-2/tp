## About Medibook
MediBook is a **desktop app for private nurse center managers, to manage patient and nurse records, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**, while still offering the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Designed for speed and efficiency, **MediBook** empowers private nurse centres to:
- Assign nurses to patients
- Retrieve patient and nurse information
- Manage checkup sessions and medical history of patients

All within a user-friendly interface that is faster than traditional pen-and-paper or GUI-based systems.

## Installation Guide

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   * Steps to check your current Java version, click [here](#faq).
   * Steps to install Java in your computer, click [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html).
   * **For Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise Java version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

> üß† **Why do I have to install Java?**
> - Java is a versatile programming language that lets apps run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Once installed, you can run any Java app, including MediBook. You can find out more about Java [here](https://dev.java/learn/getting-started/).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/releases).
   - [What is a JAR file?](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jarGuide.html)

3. Copy the file to an empty folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for MediBook.
   - MediBook will create a data folder in this _home folder_ to store your [data files](#saving-the-data).

4. Open a [command terminal](#faq), run the following commands:<br>
   ```
   cd home_folder
   java -jar MediBook.jar
   ```
   Example: if your `MediBook.jar` is in the folder `C:/Users/user/Documents`,
   Run the commands:
   ```
   cd C:/Users/user/Documents
   java -jar MediBook.jar
   ```

   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe dob/01/01/2001 p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 b/AB+ ap/Patient nok/Jane 91234567 t/Big Boy mh/High Blood Pressure` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to MediBook.

   * `edit 2 b/O+` : Edits the blood type of the 2nd contact shown in the current list to O+.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `assign 1 2`: Assigns the patient at index 1 to the nurse at index 2 shown in the current list.

   * `assign delete john doe 3` : Removes assigned nurse John Doe from the patient at index 3.

   * `find j` : Finds all contacts whose names start contains the letter 'j'.

   * `find patient of nurse 1` : Finds the patients assigned to the nurse at index 1 of the currently shown list.

   * `find nurse of patient 2` : Finds the nurses assigned to the patient at index 2 on the currently shown list.

   * `schedule add for patient 2 25/05/2025 1100` : Schedules a check-up for the patient shown at the 2nd index of the currently shown list at the given date and time.

   * `schedule delete for patient 2 25/05/2025 1100` : Deletes a check-up for the patient shown at the 2nd index of the list at the given date and time.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional ‚Äî do not include the brackets themselves when typing commands.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
