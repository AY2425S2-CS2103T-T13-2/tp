## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280"/>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below represents a generic model for command execution within the Logic component, specifically illustrating the interaction for the execute("...") API call. This model serves as a foundational framework that can be used for various command types, demonstrating how the LogicManager invokes the execute method.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `...` Command](images/GenericDiagram.png)

**Note:** The lifeline for `CommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)




The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="550">

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Feature

The `add` command allows the user to add a new person to the address book.

1. `LogicManager` receives the command text and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` parses the command and returns an `AddCommand` object.
1. `AddCommand#execute()` adds the person to the model and returns a `CommandResult`.

![Sequence Diagram](images/AddGenericDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

We chose to implement parsing with a `ParserUtil` helper class to simplify each command parser. An alternative would be using a central parser for all commands, but this was less modular.

### Edit Feature

The `edit` command allows the user to edit an existing person in the address book.

1. `LogicManager` receives the command text and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` parses the command and returns an `EditCommandParser` object.
1. `EditCommandParser#parse()` creates an `EditCommand` object.
1. `EditCommand#execute()` edits the person in the model and returns a `CommandResult`.

![Sequence Diagram](images/EditGenericDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

We chose to implement parsing with a `ParserUtil` helper class to simplify each command parser. An alternative would be using a central parser for all commands, but this was less modular.

### List Feature

The `list` command allows users to display a subset of people in the address book based on optional filters.

It supports the following use cases:
* `list` â€” Lists **all persons** in the address book (patients and nurses).
* `list nurse` or `list patient` â€” Lists **only nurses** or **only patients**, respectively.
* `list checkup` â€” Lists all patients with scheduled **checkups**, sorted by earliest checkup date.

#### Execution Flow:
1. `LogicManager` receives the command text (e.g., `"list checkup"`) and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` parses the command and returns an `ListCommandParser` object.
1. `ListCommandParser#parse()` constructs a `ListCommand` object, based on the input string.
1. `ListCommand#execute()` evaluates the internal flags:
   * If the command was `list checkup`, it calls `updateFilteredPersonListByEarliestCheckup(...)` with a `PersonHasCheckupPredicate`.
   * If no filter was provided, it lists all persons using `Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS`.
   * If a specific appointment filter was provided (e.g., `"nurse"`), it filters with `PersonHasAppointmentPredicate`.
1. A `CommandResult` is returned with a success message indicating what was listed.

![Sequence Diagram](images/ListGenericDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

We chose to centralize filtering logic inside `ListCommand`, separating parsing (`ListCommandParser`) from behavior. This approach improves maintainability and makes it easy to extend filtering options (e.g., by tag or medical history) in the future.

### Find Feature

The `find` command enables users to search for specific entities in the address book, including:
* Nurses assigned to the patients.
* Patients associated with the nurses.
* Users whose names contain the specified search terms.

This functionality improves user experience by allowing quick access to relevant information.

#### Execution Flow:
1. `LogicManager` receives the command text (e.g. `find nurse of patient 8`) from the user and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` parses the command and returns a `FindCommandParser` object.
1. Depending on the arguments, `FindCommandParser#parse()` will return one of the following:
   * `FindNurseCommand`: for searching nurses assigned to a specific patient.
   * `FindPatientCommand`: for searching patients assigned to a specific nurse.
   * `FindCommand`: a general command for searching based on keywords in contacts' names.
1. `FindCommand#execute()` retrieves the relevant entries from the model and returns a `CommandResult`.
1. For `FindNurseCommand`, it finds and returns all nurses assigned to the specified patient.
1. For `FindPatientCommand`, it finds and returns all patients assigned to the specified nurse.
1. For `FindCommand`, it allows the user to search by keywords. For example, executing `find tom harry` will return all users that contain either "tom" or "harry" in their names.

Using this command, users can effortlessly navigate and manage their address book, finding relevant information quickly and efficiently.

#### Design considerations:

We chose to implement parsing with a `ParserUtil` helper class to simplify each command parser. An alternative would be using a central parser for all commands, but this was less modular.

### Assign Feature

The `assign` command allows the user to assign a nurse to a patient.

#### Execution Flow:

1. `LogicManager` receives the command text and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` parses the command and returns an `AssignCommand` object.
1. `AssignCommand#execute()` assigns the nurse to the patient and returns a `CommandResult`.

![Sequence Diagram](images/AssignGenericDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

We chose to implement parsing with a `ParserUtil` helper class to simplify each command parser. An alternative would be using a central parser for all commands, but this was less modular.

### Schedule Feature

The `schedule` command allows the user to create a checkup between a patient and a nurse.

#### Execution Flow:

1. `LogicManager` receives the command text and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` parses the command and returns an `ScheduleCommand` object.
1. `ScheduleCommand#execute()` creates or deletes the checkup from the patient and returns a `CommandResult`.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

These are some features / improvements our team has planned to implement in the future due to lack of time.
1. Patient medical history can be edited and added on to existing medical history.
   * Currently, editing patient medical history will remove the existing medical history, meaning that if the user wants to keep the existing medical history, they would need to re-enter everything again.
   * For future enhancements, we plan to allow users to add on to the existing medical history when they edit a patient's medical history.
   * There will also be a separate command that will allow users to delete specific medical history entries for a patient.
2. The `assign` command will have a command format that is more intuitive and be easier to remember for users.
   * Currently, the `assign` command has the format: `assign PATIENT_INDEX NURSE_INDEX`, which is slightly hard to understand and is not the most intuitive.
   * For future enhancements, we plan to modify to command format to something similar to the following: `assign nurse NURSE_INDEX to patient PATIENT_INDEX`.
3. More nurses can be assigned to one patient.
   * Currently, the maximum number of nurses that can be assigned to a patient is 2.
   * For future enhancements, we may increase the number of nurses that can be assigned to a patient, as this would be more realistic for cases where multiple nurses would be needed to attend to one patient.
4. Leap year DOB / February DOB will be handled correctly.
   * Currently, DOB for leap years is not handled correctly, and dates such as 30/02/2000 are allowed in the DOB field.
   * For future enhancements, such dates will be handled correctly to only allow logical date inputs.
5. Corrupted JSON file will be handled gracefully.
   * Currently, a blank page will be displayed if the JSON file is corrupted.
   * For future enhancements, we may display a warning message to the user, and instructions would be given for reloading the app or retrieving sample data.
6. Reminders can be added for checkups.
   * Currently, checkups can be scheduled for a patient, but nurses will not receive a reminder about the checkups for the patients that they are assigned to.
   * For future enhancements, a reminder feature would allow nurses to receive reminders in advance for the patient checkups that they are assigned to.
7. Warning messages will be displayed when scheduling checkups for patients who do not have any assigned nurses.
   * Currently, users are allowed to schedule checkups for patients even if the patient does not have any nurses assigned to them.
   * For future enhancements, a warning will be displayed to alert the user that the patient they are scheduling a checkup for does not have any assigned nurses.
8. Nearly similar person `edit` handling is not consistent due to the search functionality.
   * A nearly identical person refers to a person that has all of the same person attributes as another person, except
   for any one of these attributes: `name`, `phone number` and `date of birth`.
   * Currently, the `edit` command **may** not work if it is applied to a nearly similar person, that is not the first person in line among the nearly identical person, shown in the current list. 
   * `edit` will tend to edit the first person in line among the nearly identical persons, instead of the one that is
   intended to be edited (i.e. the nearly identical person not first in line).

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level
Our project was highly complex as it expanded on the AddressBook 3 (AB3) baseline . We had to manage multiple new entity types such as patients, nurses, appointments, checkups and medical history compared to AB3 which only manages 1 person entity. Our project required careful coordination and encapsulation of all related data attributes.

### Challenges Faced
1. Multi-entity Integration
   * We introduced distinct roles like patient and nurse via an appointment field and had to integrate these new fields into the system. E.g. adjusting both add and edit functions to allow the changes to these fields.
   * We then had to design features specific to these such as nurse assignment and checkup scheduling.
1. Checkup Scheduling
   * Implementing checkup scheduling requires the introduction of a Checkup entity and validations like conflicting checkups.
1. Optional and Validated Fields
   * We added some optional fields like NextOfKin, which necessitated custom validation logic while ensuring the rest of the systems remained robust.
1. Command Complexity
   * We had to design new commands like assign and schedule, as well as enhance the current existing commands in AB3 (add, edit, list, etc.). These had to handle entity-specific behavior such as enforcing rules and validations.

### Effort Required
Our project required effort in these 4 main aspects:
1. Design and Refactoring
   * Significant refactoring was done to support distinct entity behavior while keeping the core model extensible.

1. Command System
   * Multiple new commands and parser classes were developed to enable features like nurse-patient assignment and checkup scheduling.

1. Validation and Edge Cases 
   * Custom checks were built into the logic and parser layers to prevent invalid operations (e.g., assigning a non-nurse or scheduling duplicate checkups).

1. Testing and Debugging
   * Each new command and behavior introduced unique test cases. We implemented extensive unit and integration tests to ensure system reliability.

### Achievements
Despite the complexity and effort required, our final project offers a user-friendly and extensible system. Our main achievements in this project were: implementing scheduling of medical checkups with conflict management implemented, list command with important filters such as checkup existence, allowing more optional fields like next of kin and email to provide more flexibility to the user, and last but not least adjusting requirements of duplicate persons to better match real world situations.
