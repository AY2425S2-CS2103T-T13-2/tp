### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280"/>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Feature

The `add` command allows the user to add a new person to the address book.

1. `LogicManager` receives the command text and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` parses the command and returns an `AddCommand` object.
1. `AddCommand#execute()` adds the person to the model and returns a `CommandResult`.

![Sequence Diagram](...)

#### Design considerations:

We chose to implement parsing with a `ParserUtil` helper class to simplify each command parser. An alternative would be using a central parser for all commands, but this was less modular.

### Edit Feature

The `edit` command allows the user to edit an existing person in the address book.

1. `LogicManager` receives the command text and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` parses the command and returns an `EditCommandParser` object.
1. `EditCommandParser#parse()` creates an `EditCommand` object.
1. `EditCommand#execute()` edits the person in the model and returns a `CommandResult`.

![Sequence Diagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

We chose to implement parsing with a `ParserUtil` helper class to simplify each command parser. An alternative would be using a central parser for all commands, but this was less modular.

### List Feature

The `list` command allows users to display a subset of people in the address book based on optional filters.

It supports the following use cases:
* `list` â€” Lists **all persons** in the address book (patients and nurses).
* `list nurse` or `list patient` â€” Lists **only nurses** or **only patients**, respectively.
* `list checkup` â€” Lists all persons with scheduled **checkups**, sorted by earliest checkup date.

#### Execution Flow:
1. `LogicManager` receives the command text (e.g., `"list checkup"`) and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` uses a `ListCommandParser` to interpret the command.
1. `ListCommandParser#parse()` constructs a `ListCommand` object, based on the input string.
1. `ListCommand#execute()` evaluates the internal flags:
    - If the command was `list checkup`, it calls `updateFilteredPersonListByEarliestCheckup(...)` with a `PersonHasCheckupPredicate`.
    - If no filter was provided, it lists all persons using `Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS`.
    - If a specific appointment filter was provided (e.g., `"nurse"`), it filters with `PersonHasAppointmentPredicate`.
1. A `CommandResult` is returned with a success message indicating what was listed.

![Sequence Diagram](images/ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

We chose to centralize filtering logic inside `ListCommand`, separating parsing (`ListCommandParser`) from behavior. This approach improves maintainability and makes it easy to extend filtering options (e.g., by tag or medical history) in the future.

### Find Feature

The `find` command enables users to search for specific entities in the address book, including:
* Nurses assigned to the patients.
* Patients associated with the nurses.
* Users whose names contain the specified search terms.

This functionality improves user experience by allowing quick access to relevant information.

#### Execution Flow:
1. `LogicManager` receives the command text from the user and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. Depending on the arguments, `AddressBookParser` will return one of the following:
    - `FindNurseCommand`: for searching nurses assigned to a specific patient.
    - `FindPatientCommand`: for searching patients assigned to a specific nurse.
    - `FindCommand`: a general command for searching based on keywords in user names.
1. `AddressBookParser` parses the command and returns the appropriate `FindCommand` object.
1. `FindCommand#execute()` retrieves the relevant entries from the model and returns a `CommandResult`.
1. For `FindNurseCommand`, it finds and returns all nurses assigned to the specified patient.
1. For `FindPatientCommand`, it finds and returns all patients assigned to the specified nurse.
1. For `FindCommand`, it allows the user to search by keywords. For example, executing `find tom harry` will return all users that contain either "tom" or "harry" in their names.

Using this command, users can effortlessly navigate and manage their address book, finding relevant information quickly and efficiently.

#### Design considerations:

We chose to implement parsing with a `ParserUtil` helper class to simplify each command parser. An alternative would be using a central parser for all commands, but this was less modular.

### Assign Feature

The `assign` command allows the user to assign a nurse to a patient.

1. `LogicManager` receives the command text and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` parses the command and returns an `AssignCommand` object.
1. `AssignCommand#execute()` assigns the nurse to the patient and returns a `CommandResult`.

![Sequence Diagram](images/AssignSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

We chose to implement parsing with a `ParserUtil` helper class to simplify each command parser. An alternative would be using a central parser for all commands, but this was less modular.

### Schedule Feature

The `schedule` command allows the user to create a checkup between a patient and a nurse.

1. `LogicManager` receives the command text and passes it to `AddressBookParser`.
1. `AddressBookParser` parses the command and returns an `ScheduleCommand` object.
1. `ScheduleCommand#execute()` creates or deletes the checkup from the patient and returns a `CommandResult`.
