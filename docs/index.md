**MediBook is a new desktop application, designed for Private Nurse Agencies** usage:
* To manage nurses and their patients details.
* To assign nurses to patients and schedule appointments.
* To search and filter nurses or patients quickly.

While it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

**Get Started:**
* If you are interested in using MediBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing MediBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
