[![CI Status](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/actions)

* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * As a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * As a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _MediBook_) used for managing nurses and their patient's contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[MediBook Product Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-t13-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.

**Acknowledgements:**
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
